Transkript is a speech-to-text application built using Assembly AI's API.

The project is temporarily deployed here, if you would like to see it working. However I will move it to it's own domain upon completion once some bugs have been fixed.

Alternatively you can clone then run a live server on the src code and see it working.

This project is still in active development so any feedback is much appreciated.
